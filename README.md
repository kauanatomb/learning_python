# Welcome to My Python Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to my journey of learning Python by myself. Here, I document my progress and showcase various Python scripts and projects that I've been working on.

## Python Data Structure Manipulations

In the `data_structure` directory, you'll find Python scripts that demonstrate manipulations of different data structures such as lists, sets, and tuples. These scripts are designed to help me understand Python's built-in data structures and their associated methods and operations. By exploring these scripts, I aim to deepen my understanding of Python programming and improve my coding skills.

## Simple Banking System

In the `bank_system` directory, you'll find a Python script that simulates a simple banking system. This project allows me to apply my Python programming skills in a practical context and understand concepts such as user input handling, conditional statements, loops, and basic data manipulation.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the directories and dive into the scripts. Each Python file contains comments and explanations to guide you through the code. Experiment with the code, make modifications, and see how it affects the program's behavior. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions for improvement.

## Contribution

While this repository primarily serves as a personal learning space, I welcome constructive feedback and contributions from the community. If you have any ideas for improvement or would like to collaborate on a project, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## About Me

I'm a self-taught programmer passionate about learning and exploring new technologies. Python is my current focus, and I'm excited to continue my journey of mastering this programming language.

Happy coding!
