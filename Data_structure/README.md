# Python Data Structure Manipulations

This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating manipulations of different data structures.

## list.py

The `list.py` file illustrates various manipulations that can be performed on lists in Python. It covers operations such as appending, clearing, copying, counting, extending, indexing, inserting, popping, removing, reversing, sorting, and obtaining the length of a list using the `len()` function.

## tuple.py

The `tuple.py` file focuses on manipulations of tuples in Python. It covers the following operations such as declare a tuple (immutable list), access an element, cut the tuple, count the number of elements in a tuple using the `len()` function and to find the index of the first occurrence of a specified value in a tuple.

## set.py

The `set.py` file covers operations on sets in Python. It demonstrates operations such as union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference, subset check, superset check, disjoint check, addition of elements to a set, popping elements from a set, removing specified elements from a set, and checking for the presence of an element in a set using the `in` keyword. It also discusses the difference between the `remove()` and `discard()` methods for removing elements from sets.

## dictionaries.py

The `dictionaries.py` script demonstrates manipulations of dictionaries in Python. It covers operations such as declaring dictionaries, accessing data, adding data, removing data, changing data, working with nested dictionaries, iterating through dictionaries, combining dictionaries, clearing dictionaries, copying dictionaries, creating keys from a list, checking if a key exists, and getting keys and values.

## functions.py
The `functions.py` script showcases different aspects of defining and using functions in Python.
- Positional Only Parameters
- Keyword Only Parameters
- Global and Local Variables
- Lambda Functions

Each script provides practical examples of manipulating the respective data structure, helping learners understand Python's built-in data structures and their associated methods and operations.

Feel free to explore each script to gain insights into common programming tasks involving lists, sets, tuples, dictionaries and functions.
